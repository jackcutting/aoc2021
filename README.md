# Advent of Code 2021

This year, I have decided to write AoC in (Dart)[https://dart.dev] because I have been learning (Flutter)[https://flutter.dev] this year.

## Running Code

To run the code, navigate into a day directory and run:

```bash
    # For part 1
    dart main.dart
```

```bash
    # For part 2
    dart main.dart 2
```
